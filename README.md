Modules needed are turtle, random, time, and numpy

Run the program and a virtual Rubik's Cube will appear

You can change the turn speed by changing line 9 in the program. The higher the turn speed, the faster the turns. A turn speed of 160 is instant. A turn speed of 0 or greater than 160 will cause an error.

Type keys to turn sides. The keys are meant to mimic finger tricks on the physical Rubik's Cube

P to rotate cube around the y-axis clockwise from the perspective of the top side, A or Q to rotate counterclockwise
T or Y to rotate cube around the x-axis clockwise from the perspective of the right side, B to rotate couterclockwise

J and F to turn top face clockwise and counterclockwise respectively
H and G to turn front face clockwise and counterclockwise respectively
I and K to turn right face clockwise and counterclockwise respectively
D and E to turn left face clockwise and counterclockwise respectively
S and L to turn bottom face clockwise and counterclockwise respectively
W and O to turn back face clockwise and counterclockwise respectively

X and 6 to turn the middle layer clockwise and counterclock wise respectively from the perspective of the right side

U and M to do a wide right move clockwise and counterclockwise respectively
R and V to do a wide left move clockwise and counterclockwise respectively

space to scramble
0 to close the Rubik's Cube window
